	<h1>Bacterial Snack Attack Deactivates a Drug</h1>
	<p>Johnny Ha</p>
	A class of bacteria called Gammaproteobacteria has metabolic effects on anticancer drugs, which
	are drugs that help effectively treat cancerous diseases. Anticancer drugs can treat cancerous diseases by
	destroying the DNA of tumor cells, thereby killing the cancerous cells of the disease.
	Gammaproteobacteria belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family and can be found in foods if food
	poisoning is encountered. For example, a well-known pathogen, E.coli belongs to this class of bacteria,
	thus, foods can be carrying this bacteria. The various effects were studied on mice, where E. coli was
	injected into their blood. The final results of the study shows that a gene present in some species within
	this class of bacteria, called cytidine deaminase gene, produces an enzyme that is able to metabolize
	certain chemotherapy drugs. The metabolized chemotherapy drugs turn into their inactive forms through a
	process called deamination, rendering them as ineffective cancer treatments. Bacteria normally does not
	enter the pancreatic cells of healthy individuals, therefore the resistance response is related to an immune
	function, leading to the theory that bacterial interactions with cells in the immune system influenced the
	effectiveness of cancer therapies. Therefore, cancer therapies are not 100% effective as advertised and
	known for. Overall, microbial metabolism is possibly a contributor to the deficient prognosis of cancer
	treatments.</p>
